# [Broom of Animated Attack](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/broom-of-animated-attack-cos.md)
*Source: Curse of Strahd p. 226*  

A broom of animated attack is easily mistaken for a broom of flying. It attacks any creature that grabs it or tries to ride it.

## Flying Broom

Some brooms of animated attack allow their creators to ride them, in which case they behave like typical brooms of flying. A broom of animated attack, however, can carry only half the weight that a broom of flying can (see chapter 7, "Treasure," of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
