      \ can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take\
      \ either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last\
      \ for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\
      \ turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
