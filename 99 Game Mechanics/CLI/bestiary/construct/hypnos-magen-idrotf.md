# [Hypnos Magen](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/hypnos-magen-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 301*  

Hypnos magen are telepathic and use their power of suggestion to control others. Their creators use them to force enemies to withdraw or surrender.

A hypnos magen carries no weapons, relying entirely on its psychic abilities to manipulate and harm other creatures.

Magen are magical, humanlike beings created by a wizard spell (see the [create magen](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-magen-idrotf.md) spell in appendix D) or by other arcane methods.

Though magen look like humanoids with green skin, they are constructs. When one is wounded, its blood is seen to have the color and consistency of mercury. They exist purely through magical means. When one is killed, its body disappears in a burst of harmless fire and a cloud of smoke that quickly dissipates.
