      \ the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near\
      \ enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference\
      \ for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues\
      \ to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.\n\nThe golem's\
      \ creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking\
      \ firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must\
      \ take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion))\
