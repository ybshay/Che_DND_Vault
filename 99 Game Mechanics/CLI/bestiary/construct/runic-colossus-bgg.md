# [Runic Colossus](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/runic-colossus-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 163*  

According to *The Saga of the Dragon Queller*, told by giants on some worlds, a disparate group of giants combined their efforts to protect their ancient empire from a particularly vicious dragon. Stone and hill giants hewed a mighty form from living stone. Cloud and frost giants gathered rare metals, and fire giants shaped them into flexible joints and plated armor. Storm giants inscribed runes into the inert form to give it the semblance of life. The fruit of these labors was an everlasting guardian: the first runic colossus.

A runic colossus stands 30 feet tall. It regards all non-giants as a threat, and unless it has other orders, it attacks such creatures on sight.

The art of crafting a runic colossus is lost to modern giants, but many tales suggest the instructions might be buried deep in ruins from ancient giants' empires.
