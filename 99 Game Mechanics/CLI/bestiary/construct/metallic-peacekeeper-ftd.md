# [Metallic Peacekeeper](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/metallic-peacekeeper-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 210*  

When a metallic dragon grows attached to a settlement of smaller folk—often after dwelling there for a time in Humanoid form—the dragon might decide to create a metallic peacekeeper to protect the place. The peacekeeper can ward a community for centuries, standing in the place of its dragon creator and maintaining peace and order.

## Metallic Sentinels

A metallic sentinel is a guardian created by a metallic dragon, forged from the metal associated with its creator and powered by the energy of the dragon's breath. An artificial being sculpted in elegant filigree, it is dedicated to defusing tensions that could spiral into violence.
