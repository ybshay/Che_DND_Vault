# [Indentured Spirit](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/indentured-spirit-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 206*  

Those who die with unpaid debts to the Orzhov Syndicate don't get a reprieve. Instead, their spirits serve the syndicate until they have worked off their obligation. Sometimes that means existing as an indentured spirit for years or even millennia.

An indentured spirit is an incorporeal being draped in ghostly black robes and a hood that hides whatever face it might have. Chains are hung around its chest and arms as a perpetual marker of its servitude.
