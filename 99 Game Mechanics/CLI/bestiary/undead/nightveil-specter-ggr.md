# [Nightveil Specter](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/nightveil-specter-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 215*  

The Nightveil specters of Ravnica are hooded, undead guardians that ride flying creatures called gloamwings. They are fearsome agents of House Dimir, protecting the territory and interests of that guild-particularly the neighborhood of Nightveil, from which the specters get their name. Their work can include driving off people who accidentally wander too close to a secret rooftop meeting, killing those who knowingly infiltrate Dimir property, and tracking those who have stolen guild secrets, then wiping those secrets from their victims' minds to ensure that they are never shared.

## Limited Sentience

A Nightveil specter is created when the mind magic of House Dimir erases a person's identity, leaving a mind so broken it can no longer live. Thus, Nightveil specters have no memory of their previous lives, and they are just clever enough to follow their orders with some amount of creativity. They pursue their assigned tasks with fearless determination.

## Gloamwing Mount

If a gloamwing is killed, its specter becomes fixated on destroying those responsible. If the specter survives, it can create a new gloamwing over the course of a month, during which time the specter is [incapacitated](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

A gloamwing's head is almost ratlike, with prominent teeth, and its leathery skin is stretched tight over its skull, where its eyes are empty sockets. Its body is mottled with bony plates, and great wings stretch from its shoulders.

## Undead Nature

A Nightveil specter and its gloamwing mount don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
