# [Ash Zombie](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ash-zombie-lmop.md)
*Source: Lost Mine of Phandelver p. 31*  

From somewhere in the darkness, a gurgling moan is heard. A form lurches into view, dragging one foot as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.

## Ash Zombies

These zombies were created by the magical devastation when Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago. They use the zombie stat block, with the following additional trait.

### Ash Puff

The first time the zombie takes damage, any living creature within 5 feet of the zombie must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it early with a successful save.
