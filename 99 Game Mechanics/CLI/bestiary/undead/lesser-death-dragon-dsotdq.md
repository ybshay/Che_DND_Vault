# [Lesser Death Dragon](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/lesser-death-dragon-dsotdq.md)
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 195*  

Most death dragons are pale imitations of their former selves. They remember flashes and echoes, and sometimes things or creatures they encounter painfully remind them of what they once had. These fleeting moments of lucidity quickly burn away in rage and anguish, driving the dragons to destroy the would-be memento.

## Death Dragons

Death dragons are the Undead skeletal remains of metallic or chromatic dragons, infused with the lingering fires of the Cataclysm by foul magic. Rarely, death dragons arise when a dragon meets its end in a way that torments its soul and consumes it with a need for vengeance. Regardless of how it arose, a death dragon retains a shadow of its former personality. The stronger the death dragon, the more it fights the hate consuming it, holding on to some vestige of its memories.

A death dragon's bones burn with violet Cataclysmic fire, which it can unleash in a horrific mockery of the breath weapon it possessed in life. The breath snuffs out life force and infuses undeath into corpses it touches. These zombies burn with Cataclysmic fire and serve the death dragon's will, typically going on rampages to destroy all living creatures in sight.
