# [Spectral Cloud](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/spectral-cloud-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 176*  

A cloud giant that dies through an act of betrayal or an ill-fated wager sometimes returns as a spectral cloud. While this Undead seems to be merely a thick cloud or fog bank, observers can sometimes spot a shadowy bipedal figure lurking within. At the heart of the cloud, the figure's appearance becomes clear: a skeletal cloud giant corpse.

Tales suggest cloud giants sometimes seek this fate rather than accept the end of their naturally long lives. In such stories, a cloud giant undergoes a ritual in which its heart is transplanted into a cloud, causing the giant's body to dissolve and its spirit to animate the cloud.
