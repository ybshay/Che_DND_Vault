# [Obzedat Ghost](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/obzedat-ghost-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 245*  

The ghosts who make up the Obzedat are traditionally called patriarchs, though they can be male or female. They are the oldest, wealthiest, and most influential oligarchs of the Orzhov Syndicate. They have been dead for centuries, but they refuse to let go of the fortunes they amassed in life. Addicted to power and prestige, these patriarchs continue to dominate the guild and accumulate even larger fortunes.

## Mostly Unanimous

The ghosts of the Obzedat function as a unit, driven by their shared desire to accumulate ever more wealth for the guild. In times of disagreement, the eldest of the council exerts his seniority to bend the council to his will.

## Grandfather Karlov

The head of the council, who gives final approval to its decisions and breaks ties within the group, is Karlov, known as Grandfather. In life, Karlov was the greediest of Orzhov oligarchs, and his many centuries as a spirit have not diminished his hunger for more wealth.

## Undead Nature

An Obzedat ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
