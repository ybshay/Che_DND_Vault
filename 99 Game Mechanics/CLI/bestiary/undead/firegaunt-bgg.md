# [Firegaunt](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/firegaunt-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 137*  

A fire giant whose burning hatred prevents it from moving on to the afterlife rises as a firegaunt. Spawned from deep rancor, the firegaunt seeks out living creatures to destroy. Like a specter, it doesn't seek redemption; it just hopes to cause as much destruction as possible before attaining its final oblivion.

A firegaunt looks like a severely burned corpse. Supernatural crimson flames flow through its veins, erupting from its wounds and its mouth.
