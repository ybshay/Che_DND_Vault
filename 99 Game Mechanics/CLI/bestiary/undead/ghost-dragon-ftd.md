# [Ghost Dragon](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghost-dragon-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 203*  

A dragon's attachment to a hoard can be strong enough to bind the dragon's spirit to existence after death. Such a ghost dragon haunts the hoard, often forming an attachment to a single priceless object that becomes the focus of the ghost dragon's Undead existence.

A ghost dragon is a translucent and incorporeal version of the original dragon. Though its breath weapon resembles ghostly flames, lightning, or acid, it carries an otherworldly curse. The breath's shadowy mist can induce waking nightmares.
