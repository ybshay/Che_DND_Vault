  - "desc": "If the priest drops to 0 hit points, roll on the Boons of Undeath table\
      \ for the boon the priest receives. The priest dies if it receives a boon it\
      \ already has. If it receives a new boon, it revives at the start of its next\
      \ turn with half its hit points restored, and its creature type is now Undead.\n\
      \nTo prevent this revival, the Tattoo of Osybus on the priest's body must be\
      \ destroyed. The tattoo is invulnerable while the priest has at least 1 hit\
      \ point. The tattoo is otherwise an object with AC 15, and it is immune to poison\
      \ and psychic damage. It has 15 hit points, but it regains all its hit points\
      \ at the end of every combatant's turn."

  - "desc": "Eerie whispers can now be heard around the priest. Any non-Undead creature\
      \ that starts its turn within 30 feet of the priest must succeed on a DC 15\
      \ Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\

      \ (2d4 + 2) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it is [paralyzed](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed)\
      \ until the start of the priest's next turn. If this damage reduces a Medium\
      \ or smaller creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies, and its soul is trapped\
      \ in the priest's body, manifesting as a shadowy Soul Tattoo on the priest.\
      \ The soul is freed if the priest dies."

      \ the start of the priest's next turn."
    "name": "Necrotic Bolt"
"bonus_actions":
  - "desc": "The priest touches one of the Soul Tattoos on its body. The tattoo vanishes\
      \ as the trapped soul manifests as a shadowy creature that appears in an unoccupied\
      \ space the priest can see within 30 feet of it. The creature has the size and\
      \ silhouette of its original body, but it otherwise uses the stat block of a\
      \ shadow.\n\nThe shadow obeys the priest's mental commands (no action required)\
      \ and takes its turn immediately after the priest. If the creature is within\
      \ 5 feet of the priest, it can turn back into a tattoo as an action, reappearing\
      \ on the priest's flesh and regaining all its hit points."
