# [Devkarin Lich](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/devkarin-lich-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 198*  

Powerful spellcasters of the Devkarin elves, steeped in Golgari magic, can transcend death to become liches. For them, life and death don't merely chase each other in an inevitable cycle; the two can intersect, and at that nexus the liches find immense power, which commands the awe, envy, and fear of other Golgari.

Unlike the shambling zombies they command, liches retain their memories, their personalities, and especially their ambition. They also retain the grace and stature of living elves, but their bodies are in a constant state of slow decay. Various forms of fungus grow in and over the rotting flesh to hold the body together.

## Undead Nature

The lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
