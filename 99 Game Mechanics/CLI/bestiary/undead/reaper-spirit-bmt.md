      \ as you. Additionally, if the target starts its turn within 10 feet of the\
      \ spirit, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell\
      \ save DC or have the [frightened](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
      \ condition until the start of the target's next turn. The target remains haunted\
      \ until it dies, the spirit disappears, or the spirit uses this action again."
