# [Icewind Kobold Zombie](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/icewind-kobold-zombie-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 297*  

The necromancer Vellynne Harpell has Icewind kobold guides in her employ, including a pair that died and were turned into zombies using [animate dead](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/animate-dead.md) spells. The cold climate helps to preserve their dead flesh.
