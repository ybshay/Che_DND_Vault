# [Spawn of Kyuss](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/spawn-of-kyuss-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 225, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 192*  

Kyuss was a high priest of Orcus who plundered corpses from necropolises to create the first spawn of Kyuss. Even centuries after Kyuss's death, his malign disciples continue performing the horrific rites he perfected.

From a distance or in poor light, a spawn of Kyuss looks like an ordinary zombie. As it comes into clearer view, however, the scores of little green worms crawling in and out of it become visible. These worms jump onto nearby Humanoids and burrow into their flesh. A worm that penetrates a Humanoid body makes its way to the creature's brain. Once inside the brain, the worm kills its host and animates the corpse, transforming it into a spawn of Kyuss, which breeds more worms.

Spawn of Kyuss are expressions of Orcus's intent to replace all life with undeath. Left to its own devices, a solitary spawn of Kyuss travels aimlessly. If it stumbles across a living creature, the spawn attacks with the sole intent of creating more spawn. Whether spawn are dispersed or clustered, they reproduce exponentially if nothing stops them.

      \ Undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, and a speed\
      \ of 1 foot. While on the target's skin, the worm can be killed by normal means\
      \ or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use Burrowing Worm to launch\
      \ a scraped-off worm at a Humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise,\
      \ the worm burrows under the target's skin at the end of the target's next turn,\

      \ the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum\
      \ of 10d6), and if it drops to 0 hit points, it dies and then rises 10 minutes\
