      \ that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's\

      \ the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but\
      \ can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Until initiative count\
      \ 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings,\
      \ and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.  \n- The hag targets any number\
      \ of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or\
      \ close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful\
      \ DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked,\
      \ or until she uses this lair action again to open them.  \n\nA powerful night\
      \ hag might have the following additional lair actions:\n\n- One creature the\
      \ hag can see within 120 feet of her must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving\
      \ throw or be banished to a prison demiplane. To escape, the creature must use\
      \ its action to make a Charisma check contested by the hag's. If the creature\
      \ wins, it escapes the demiplane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count\
      \ 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the\
      \ space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.\
      \  \n- The hag targets up to three creatures that she can see within 60 feet\
      \ of her. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be\
      \ flung up to 30 feet through the air. A creature that strikes a solid object\
      \ or is released in midair takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet\
      \ moved or fallen.  "

"regional_effects":
  - "desc": "Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the\
      \ home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair\
      \ of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional\
      \ effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of\
      \ the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the\
      \ hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.\n\n\
      The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's\
      \ fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Birds,\
      \ rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to\
      \ the hag) are found in great profusion.  \n- Beasts that have an Intelligence\
      \ score of 2 or lower are [charmed](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.  \n\
      - Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in\
      \ trees.  \n\nA powerful night hag creates one or more of the following additional\
      \ regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:\n\n- Shadows seem abnormally gaunt\
      \ and sometimes move on their own as though alive.  \n- Creatures are transported\
      \ to a harmless but eerie demiplane filled with shadowy forms, waxy corpses,\
      \ and cackling. The creatures are trapped there for a minute or two, and then\
      \ returned to the place where they vanished from.  \n- Intelligent creatures\
      \ see hallucinations of dead friends, family members, and even themselves littering\
      \ the hag's realm. Any attempt to interact with a hallucinatory image causes\
      \ it to disappear.  "
