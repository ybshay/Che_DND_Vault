Maw demons share the ceaseless hunger for carnage and mortal flesh of their master, Yeenoghu, who appears in this book. After a maw demon rests for 8 hours, anything devoured by it is transported directly into the Lord of Savagery's gullet.

Maw demons appear among gnoll war bands that worship Yeenoghu, usually summoned as part of ritual offerings of freshly slain Humanoids made to him. The gnolls don't command the demons, which simply accompany the war band and attack whatever creatures the gnolls fall upon.

Because maw demons are indiscriminate in their hunger, their stomachs contain all manner of oddities in addition to the remains of their recent prey. You may choose one or more items appropriate for your campaign for a maw demon to contain, or roll on the Maw Demon's Stomach Contents table.
