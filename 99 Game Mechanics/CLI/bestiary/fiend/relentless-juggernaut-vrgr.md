# [Relentless Juggernaut](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/relentless-juggernaut-vrgr.md)
*Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 243*  

Relentless juggernauts are massive brutes that thirst for carnage. Their presence twists the world around them, allowing them to create weapons with which they can slaughter prey. Sharp iron fences, crushing stalagmites and blades of glass all conveniently appear in order to aid a juggernaut's brutality. Every juggernaut considers a certain area its territory and visits destruction upon all trespassers.

Relentless killers are hateful, revenge-obsessed creatures that enter into pacts with fiends or other nefarious entities. Their bargains transform them into vicious butchers that exist only to indulge their endless bloodlust. While some who become relentless killers began life as innocents, any semblance of who they were is washed away in a tide of gore and rage. These killers' grisly work swiftly becomes the stuff of legends, striking fear into innocents across lands and over ages.

## Creating a Relentless Killer

Relentless killers come into being and undertake their terrifying sprees for a spectrum of reasons. When creating a relentless killer, consider what circumstances led to their transformation and signature methods. Roll or choose options from the Relentless Origins and Relentless Methods tables when creating your own, unique monstrous slayers.

**Relentless Origins**

| dice: d6 | Origin |
|----------|--------|

| 4 | A wicked place or magic relic seeped into its being, turning it into a monster. |
| 5 | The killer used its body to contain an evil entity. |
| 6 | The killer appears to be an ordinary person who doesn't realize it turns into a killer when enraged. |

**Relentless Methods**

| dice: d8 | Method |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Artist. The killer turns its victims into works of art, perhaps creating grisly tableaus or using their blood in the forging of new weapons. |
| 2 | Author. The killer leaves messages, poems, song lyrics, or parts of its creative masterpiece at the scenes of its crimes. |
| 3 | Avatar. The killer sacrifices its victims, believing it's a manifestation of a deity or force beyond morality. |
| 4 | Doctor. The killer dissects victims or harvests their organs for the sake of medical understanding. |
| 5 | Mask. The killer wears a distinctive disguise, its visage becoming a symbol of its crimes. |
| 6 | Penitent. The killer can't help itself from committing crimes and seeks help to thwart its own continuing violence. |
| 7 | Ritualist. The killer always attacks the same type of person in the same type of place in the same way. |
| 8 | Trophy Taker. The killer reliably collects something from its victims, hoarding them as trophies. |
