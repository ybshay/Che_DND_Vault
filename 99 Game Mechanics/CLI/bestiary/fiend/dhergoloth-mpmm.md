A kind of yugoloth, dhergoloths rush into battle like whirlwinds of destruction, lashing out with the five sets of claws that extend from their squat, barrel-shaped bodies. They take contracts to put down uprisings, clear out rabble, and eliminate scouts and skirmishers, and they revel in the butchery they create, their gleeful laughter rising above their victims' screams.

Since dhergoloths are little more than brutes, employers must use caution when instructing them. They can handle simple orders that don't take a lot of time to resolve. When given anything complex to do, however, they either forget what they're told or don't listen in the first place, and then bungle the task that was set for them.
