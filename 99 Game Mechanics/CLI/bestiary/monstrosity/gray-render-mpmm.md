# [Gray Render](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/gray-render-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 146, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 209*  

A curious impulse drives the gray render. Despite its hulking form and terrible appetite, it wants most of all to bond with an intelligent creature and, once bonded, to give its life to protect that creature. Great strength and a ferocious nature make gray renders fierce guardians, but they lack a shred of cunning.

Gray renders reproduce by forming nodules on their bodies that, on reaching maturity, break off to begin life as young gray renders. They feel no obligation to their young and have no inclination to gather with others of their kind. Instead, each has an overpowering need to bond with an intelligent creature. When one encounters a suitable master, it sings to that creature—a weird, warbling cry accompanied by scratching at the earth and a show of deference. Once it forms a bond, a gray render serves its master devotedly.

A gray render might be a strong ally, but it's always an unpredictable one. In combat, a gray render fights viciously and never willingly harms its master, but outside battle, it might cause considerable difficulties. It might follow its master despite being told to stay put, destroy its master's house, burrow holes through a ship's hull, attack out of jealousy, or worse.

The Gray Render Quirks table presents possible quirks for gray renders that can be generated randomly or selected as desired.
