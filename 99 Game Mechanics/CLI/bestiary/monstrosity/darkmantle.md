# [Darkmantle](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/darkmantle.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 46. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*  

A darkmantle clings to cavern ceilings, remaining perfectly still as it waits for creatures to pass beneath it. From a distance, it can pass itself off as a stalactite or a lump of stone. Then it drops from the ceiling and unfurls, surrounding itself with magical darkness as it engulfs and crushes its prey.

Darkmantles are found throughout the Underdark, but they are equally common on the Shadowfell. Thriving in that dark realm, they fill an ecological niche similar to bats on the Material Plane. Intelligent creatures of the Shadowfell sometimes train darkmantles as guardians or companions.
