# [Boss Delour](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/boss-delour-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 83*  

Delour the wererat is a sly trickster and consummate thief who rules the Moonstalkers alongside his friend Augustus. Delour's honeyed words and calculating mind make him dangerous. He can smile and shake someone's hand while simultaneously plotting to ruin that person.

Expanding the guild's activities beyond thievery was Delour's idea. He studies other criminal syndicates and their methods of getting rich. He considers protection rackets, smuggling, and arson to be low-hanging fruit, with extortion, kidnapping, and murder for hire being more complex challenges the guild can take on as it grows in power. His only real fear is exposure; the bigger and more active the Moonstalkers become, the more likely they are to attract the attention of law enforcement or adventurous do-gooders. The sting of the guild's flight from its first home is still fresh in Delour's mind.

Indeed, Delour never forgets a slight. He is obsessed with getting revenge on the officials who raided the original guildhall and killed Pyrite, who was like a brother to Delour. Though Delour is perfectly willing to backstab most people, he treats Augustus with utmost respect. If he discovers Augustus's plot to become human and leave the Moonstalkers, he would consider it the ultimate betrayal.
