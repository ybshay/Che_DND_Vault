# [Draconian Infiltrator](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/draconian-infiltrator-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 178*  

Copper, black, and topaz dragon eggs yield these sly and stealthy draconians, who often serve their creators as scouts and spies. They use the paralytic venom of their saliva to coat their weapons, making them formidable assassins as well. Their wings allow them to turn a fall into a rough glide. When draconian infiltrators die, their bodies dissolve into pools of acid.

On the world of Krynn, draconian infiltrators formed from copper dragon eggs are called kapak draconians.

## Draconians

Draconians are bipedal monsters born from dragon eggs that have been corrupted or warped by powerful magic. Most often, this corruption is a deliberate act, the work of an aspiring tyrant seeking to transform stolen eggs into a draconian army. A single corrupted egg yields several draconians of the same kind. A draconian might be taken for a dragonborn at first glance, though most kinds of draconians have wings.

When draconians die, they do not go quietly. Instead, their lifeless bodies unleash a last act of magical violence.
