*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 129*  

Stretching over 200 feet from the tip of its enormous nose horn to the end of its spiky tail, a ceratops gleams with lines of vibrant green energy in its thickly scaled hide. Its horn alone is larger than most giants, and the ceratops can trample ancient forests under its feet when it becomes enraged.

## Dinosaurs

When Annam's children first began to populate the worlds of the Material Plane, the All-Father created behemoth dinosaurs to live alongside them as companions. The primeval magic used to create the dinosaurs still thrums through their being and manifests in colorful, scar-like lines on their towering bodies. Some of these ancient dinosaurs persist in timeless jungles, hidden enclaves, and other lands untouched by the rest of the world.
