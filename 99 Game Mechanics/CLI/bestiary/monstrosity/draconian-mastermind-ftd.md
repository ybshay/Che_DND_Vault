# [Draconian Mastermind](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/draconian-mastermind-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 180*  

The rarest and most powerful of the draconians are the masterminds—spellcasters and strategists who most often serve as military commanders or as advisors to those who created them. They emerge from gold, red, or amethyst dragon eggs, wingless but possessed of an arsenal of eldritch power. Like their dragon progenitors, masterminds have a breath weapon—a billowing cloud of poisonous gas. They also have formidable claws and teeth they use to rend foes in close combat.

Dying draconian masterminds are a sight to behold, as their magical essence coalesces as a ball of lightning that arcs out at those nearby.

On the world of Krynn, draconian masterminds formed from gold dragon eggs are called aurak draconians.

## Draconians

Draconians are bipedal monsters born from dragon eggs that have been corrupted or warped by powerful magic. Most often, this corruption is a deliberate act, the work of an aspiring tyrant seeking to transform stolen eggs into a draconian army. A single corrupted egg yields several draconians of the same kind. A draconian might be taken for a dragonborn at first glance, though most kinds of draconians have wings.

When draconians die, they do not go quietly. Instead, their lifeless bodies unleash a last act of magical violence.
