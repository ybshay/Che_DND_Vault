# [Zargash](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md)
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 223*  

Zargash worships Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath, who has promised to transform Zargash into a vampire after a lifetime of faithful service. For a living priest to worship Orcus is utter folly, but Zargash is twisted beyond any hope of redemption. His hobbies include slaying the living and animating the dead.
