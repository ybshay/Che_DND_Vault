      \ to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.\n\n**Heartstone.**\
      \ This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is\
      \ in her possession. The touch of a [heartstone](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/items/heartstone-mm.md)\
      \ also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.\n\n**Soul Bag.**\
      \ When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting,\
      \ Morgantha catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A [soul\
      \ bag](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/items/soul-bag-mm.md) can hold only one evil\
      \ soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul\
      \ with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose\
      \ flesh is used to make the bag)."

      \ spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As\
      \ long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions\
      \ last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its\
      \ hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's\
      \ hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul\
      \ is trapped in Morgantha's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point\
      \ maximum lasts until removed by the [greater restoration](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
      \ spell or similar magic."
