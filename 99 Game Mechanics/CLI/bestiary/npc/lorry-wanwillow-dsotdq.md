      \ polymorph into a Tiny rat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true\
      \ form.\n\nWhile in bat form, Lorry can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet,\
      \ and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size\
      \ and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing\
      \ it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\n\nWhile in mist\
      \ form, Lorry can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless,\
      \ has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's\
      \ space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist\
      \ can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage\
      \ on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to\
      \ all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight."

      \ provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform,\
      \ it is destroyed.\n\nWhile it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert\
      \ to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or\
      \ be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It\
      \ is then [paralyzed](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed)\

      \ attack.\n\nEach time Lorry or Lorry's companions do anything harmful to the\
      \ target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\
