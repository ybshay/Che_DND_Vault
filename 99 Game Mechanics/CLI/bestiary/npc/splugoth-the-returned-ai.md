Sometimes a goblin can't catch a break. First, you fall in with a cult that works for the release of a death god. Then you get taken prisoner by a group of sociopathic adventurers who end up letting you die after you save their sorry lives. One minute, you're a dead goblin named Splug. And then you're alive again, and it seems like a really good idea to play up the drama of resurrection with a cool new name-and a master plan for cold, cold revenge against those who betrayed you.

Every once in a while, the (accidentally) capricious and (totally unintentionally) self-centered nature of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise might incur some collateral damage among followers, hirelings, and staff. When that happens, the collateral damage sometimes inspires some collateral damage of its own. No one is entirely sure how many times Splugoth the Returned has actually returned from the dead. But as the point goblin for the group known as the Six (see "Factions and Rivals" in chapter 3), he's made vengeance against Acq Inc and Omin Dran his life's work. And then the work of his next life. And the one after that.
