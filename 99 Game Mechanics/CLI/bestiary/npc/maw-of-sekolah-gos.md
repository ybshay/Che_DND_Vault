# [Maw of Sekolah](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/maw-of-sekolah-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 244*  

Summoned from the shadowy depths of the ocean through ritual and tidal magic, the Maw of Sekolah appears in The Final Enemy as the avatar of the hungry sahuagin god. This huge, two-headed shark is fed a steady diet of sentient creatures, captured by the sahuagin and offered up as tribute. Sahuagin priestesses adorn the fins of the maw of Sekolah with gemmed bands and polished skulls.
