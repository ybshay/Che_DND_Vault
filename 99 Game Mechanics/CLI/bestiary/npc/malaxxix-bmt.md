# [Malaxxix](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/malaxxix-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 173*  

Legends describe the dread being Malaxxix as the child of one of the night hags who created the first yugoloths. Malaxxix is often lumped in with such Fiends, perhaps because it too has a grand intellect and self-centered agenda.

Malaxxix's machinations are many, but it is most infamous for crafting cursed armaments and distributing them throughout the multiverse in the hope that they'll be found by mortals who are desperate for power and ripe for corruption.

Malaxxix seeks the *Books of Keeping*: ancient tomes that contain the true names of all yugoloths. To this end, it patrols the vilest swaths of the multiverse from atop its unholy vehicle, the Unborn Palanquin. This shambling collective is made up of thousands of mezzoloths devoted to their liege, who roams the Lower Planes as a tyrannical marauder.

## Curse of Malaxxix

A creature that attunes to one of Malaxxix's cursed items becomes afflicted with the curse of Malaxxix. The curse enables Malaxxix to interact with the cursed creature in special ways:

### Scrying

Malaxxix can cast the Scrying spell on the cursed creature without material components or a spell slot. Malaxxix doesn't need to be on the same plane of existence as the creature to use this ability, and the creature automatically fails the saving throw against the spell.

#### Teleport

As an action, Malaxxix can teleport, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the cursed creature, regardless of the creature's location in the multiverse.

The curse of Malaxxix lasts until ended with a Remove Curse spell, a Greater Restoration spell, or similar magic.

## Malaxxix's Lair

The Unborn Palanquin—a monstrous, centipedal vehicle—serves as both Malaxxix's primary conveyance and the Fiend's lair.

Malaxxix can take lair actions (see below) while astride the palanquin. When encountered on the palanquin, Malaxxix's challenge rating is 19 (22,000 XP).

### The Unborn Palanquin

The [Unborn Palanquin](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/objects/unborn-palanquin-bmt.md) is a wormlike leviathan of screeching gears made up of hundreds of tireless mezzoloths. It is a unique vehicle and Gargantuan object.

Only Malaxxix can pilot this vehicle. If Malaxxix is slain, the palanquin crumbles in seconds.
