# [Gunvald Halraggson](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/gunvald-halraggson-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 305*  

The thirty-year-old Bear King cuts an impressive figure and is renowned for his size and strength. He tries to be honorable, but he is often merciless and doesn't change his mind easily. He has trouble relating to Ten-Towners, so he avoids them. His perspective on townsfolk might change if they helped him destroy the chardalyn berserkers who have turned against their own.

Gunvald has had three wives in six years, each of whom died while she was pregnant. His advisors fear that the gods have cursed Gunvald and the entire tribe. In truth, the king's doting shaman, Ulkora, lusts for him and surreptitiously poisoned his wives. In time, Ulkora hopes Gunvald will turn his loving eye toward her and allow her to bear his true heir. If Gunvald were to learn the truth, he would put Ulkora to death.
