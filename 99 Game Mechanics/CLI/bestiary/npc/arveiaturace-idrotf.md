# [Arveiaturace](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/arveiaturace-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 105*  

Known to Ten-Towners as the White Wyrm, Arveiaturace is an ancient white dragon that lairs atop the Reghed Glacier. She remains the most fearsome predator in Icewind Dale, although age has clouded her eyes with cataracts, limiting the range of her vision to 60 feet. Her blindsight, hearing, and sense of smell are undiminished, however. Fortunately for the residents of the dale, she prefers the taste of reindeer, walrus, and polar bear flesh to that of humanoids. The dragon has a healthy respect for humanoids and has never threatened Ten-Towns directly, though it wouldn't take much to provoke her into doing so.

At one time, Arveiaturace served a wizard named Meltharond, whose frozen corpse remains strapped to a saddle on the dragon's back. Arveiaturace has never acknowledged his death and still speaks to his body as if he were alive. He was, while he lived, her only friend and confidant.
