# [Stone Giant of Evil Earth](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant-of-evil-earth-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 179*  

Stone giants with a bent toward cruelty and destruction might reject the gods of the Ordning and turn to the worship of Ogrémoch, the Prince of Evil Earth. These giants view the surface world not as a realm of dream but as a nightmare worthy only of destruction, so they lend their strength to cults that plan to reduce the world to rubble.

Outfitted in heavy armor crafted to resemble the cult's patron, stone giants of Evil Earth wield weapons that pulse with thunderous energy. These giants serve as the muscle for the cult, wielding their might to destroy the surface world in the name of Ogrémoch.
