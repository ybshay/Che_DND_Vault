# [Bloodfray Giant](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/bloodfray-giant-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 200*  

Giants in the Cult of Rakdos act as enforcers, bouncers, and sometimes even pillars, holding the mobile platforms that serve as stages for Rakdos performances. Like other members of the cult, giants thrill to the violence of those shows. Though they can seem entranced by the horror unfolding on the stage, they react quickly and brutally to any interruption of the performance.

## Giants

Giants use their tremendous size and strength to advance the cause of no less than four guilds. In the Boros Legion and the Orzhov Syndicate, they are cunning soldiers. The giants of the Cult of Rakdos and the Gruul Clans are no less effective but lack discipline.
