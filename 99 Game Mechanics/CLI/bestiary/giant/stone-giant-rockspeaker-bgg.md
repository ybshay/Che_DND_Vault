# [Stone Giant Rockspeaker](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant-rockspeaker-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 180*  

Stone giants practice rune magic more than other giants do, perhaps because of these giants' interest in and aptitude for carving stone. Stone giants who combine this magic with prodigious artistic skill are called rockspeakers. Within their communities, they act as leaders and oracles.

Rockspeakers incorporate crystals and stones into their clothing and embed them in their skin. By invoking the power of their stone runes, these giants can turn these crystals into scintillating works of art. In combat, rockspeakers can use this same magic to cause their crystals to emit brilliantly colored, intense beams of light than can sear flesh and inhibit enemies.
