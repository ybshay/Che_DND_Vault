# [Fomorian Noble](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fomorian-noble-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 143*  

Before their banishment to the Underdark, fomorians ordered themselves based on achievements of knowledge and magical power. Before Karontor urged his descendants into an ill-fated assault against the Feywild, some of the most ambitious, inquisitive, and power-hungry fomorians felt they had already learned all they could from the Material Plane, and they departed to the Inner Planes, where they could continue their journeys of knowledge unopposed.

In their arrogance, these fomorian nobles unknowingly escaped the dreadful fate of their kin, and they remain unchanged in their remote enclaves. Occasionally they return to the Material Plane to survey the world they left. With angular features and apparently ageless faces, these fomorians resemble gigantic elves.

## Fomorians

Descended from Annam's son Karontor, fomorians once occupied a place in the giants' ordning between hill and stone giants. In ancient times, they were scholars of magic known for their keen intellect—but also for their inflated egos and sense of entitlement. Karontor exploited these qualities, tempting them with promises of higher standing in the ordning, and incited his descendants to launch an assault on the Feywild. When the assault failed, the fomorians were banished to the Underdark and their god was consigned to a subterranean prison. Subjected to the strange magic of the Underdark, the fomorians' bodies and souls twisted until they became the fomorians of today.
