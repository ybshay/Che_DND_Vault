# [Fomorian Deep Crawler](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fomorian-deep-crawler-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 142*  

Deep crawlers are fomorians whose bodies are adapted to crawling through the tunnels of the Underdark, perhaps in imitation or in honor of Karontor, "the king that crawls." Their limbs are long and sinuous, and their grip is strong enough for them to climb walls and ceilings.

## Fomorians

Descended from Annam's son Karontor, fomorians once occupied a place in the giants' ordning between hill and stone giants. In ancient times, they were scholars of magic known for their keen intellect—but also for their inflated egos and sense of entitlement. Karontor exploited these qualities, tempting them with promises of higher standing in the ordning, and incited his descendants to launch an assault on the Feywild. When the assault failed, the fomorians were banished to the Underdark and their god was consigned to a subterranean prison. Subjected to the strange magic of the Underdark, the fomorians' bodies and souls twisted until they became the fomorians of today.
