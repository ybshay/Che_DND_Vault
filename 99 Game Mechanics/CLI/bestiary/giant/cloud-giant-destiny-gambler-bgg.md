# [Cloud Giant Destiny Gambler](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant-destiny-gambler-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 124*  

Cloud giants rise in the ordning by amassing valuable and beautiful treasures—often by gambling. While many cloud giants are content with risking their wealth in games with each other, those who aim for the top of their ordning challenge all manner of beings in games of chance and wit. A destiny gambler is a cloud giant who has won increasingly high-stakes wagers against other giants, smaller folk, and even beings from the Outer Planes.

Destiny gamblers wear half masks that cover their eyes. The masks' runic magic allows these giants not only to see normally, but also to see through illusions, invisibility, darkness, and other forms of magical trickery.

Years of successful wagers make destiny gamblers so confident in their ability to win any challenge that they invite potential rivals to name the terms of a wager. Those who are foolish enough to issue a combat challenge quickly find these giants' magical prowess is nearly unmatched.
