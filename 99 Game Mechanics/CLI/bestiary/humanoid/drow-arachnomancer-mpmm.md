# [Drow Arachnomancer](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow-arachnomancer-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 99, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 182*  

Drow spellcasters who seek to devote themselves wholly to [Lolth](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/deities/drow-lolth-mtf.md), the Spider Queen, sometimes walk the sinister path of the arachnomancer. By offering up body and soul to Lolth, they gain tremendous power and a supernatural connection to the ancient spiders of the Demonweb Pits, channeling magic from that dread place.
