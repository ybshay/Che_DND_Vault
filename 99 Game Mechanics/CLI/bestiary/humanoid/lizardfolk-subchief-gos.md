# [Lizardfolk Subchief](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk-subchief-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 242*  

The lizardfolk subchief (seen in Danger at Dunwater) is a devout priest of Semuanya, pursuing the worship of its god in a manner similar to a cleric. It wields a dagger crafted of a massive crocodile tooth blessed by Semuanya, representing the subchief's prowess in both battle and piety.
