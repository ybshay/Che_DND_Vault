# [Dragonborn of Bahamut](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/dragonborn-of-bahamut-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 184*  

Often called platinum knights, dragonborn champions of Bahamut might belong to an order that exists to protect the world from evil—and especially from evil dragons. A champion of Bahamut has a distinctive pair of platinum wings and a breath weapon suffused with radiant energy.

## Dragonborn Champions

The connection between dragonborn and their draconic ancestors manifests in a variety of ways. Some dragonborn identify with a particular kind of dragon and attempt to emulate such dragons' attitudes and behavior. Others consider their draconic heritage—chromatic, metallic, or gem—something like a large extended family. But for dragonborn champions, this bond is spiritual as much as biological, and they devote themselves to their divine ancestor. Dragonborn champions advance the cause of their dragon god among draconic creatures and other folk alike.
