# [Bard](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bard-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 59, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 211*  

Bards are gifted poets, storytellers, and entertainers who travel far and wide. They're commonly found in taverns or in the company of jolly bands of adventurers, rough-and-tumble mercenaries, and wealthy patrons.

Each bard is a master of at least one type of performance. You may choose a bard's main type, or you may roll on the Bard [Performance](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance) Types table to determine it.
