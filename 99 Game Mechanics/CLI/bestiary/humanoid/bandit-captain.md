# [Bandit Captain](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 344. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*  

It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The bandit captain has these qualities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.

More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.
