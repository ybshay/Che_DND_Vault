Apprentices are novice arcane spellcasters who serve more experienced wizards or attend school. They perform menial work like cooking or cleaning in exchange for education in the ways of magic.

## Wizards

Wizards pursue magical power through the study of arcane texts. Some travel the world searching for esoteric tomes while others train lesser wizards or collaborate with colleagues to create new spells.
