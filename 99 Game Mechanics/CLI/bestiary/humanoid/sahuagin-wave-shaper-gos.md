# [Sahuagin Wave Shaper](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin-wave-shaper-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 251*  

These hunched and twisted sahuagin sacrifice their bodies to the mutating magic of Sekolah. Wave shapers add elemental magic to sahuagin armed forces (as seen in The Final Enemy) and delight in creating destructive whirlpools.

  - "desc": "The wave shaper targets a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25\
      \ feet deep, causing a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool\
      \ forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the\
      \ top, 25 feet tall, and lasts for 1 minute or until the wave shaper is [incapacitated](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).\
      \ Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled\
      \ 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by succeeding\
      \ on a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\
      \ check.\n\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or\
      \ starts its turn there, it must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failed\
      \ save, the creature takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and is caught in the\
      \ vortex until it ends. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't\
      \ caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to\
      \ try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but it has disadvantage\
      \ on the Strength ([Athletics](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\
      \ check to do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex,\
      \ the object takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. This damage occurs each round\
      \ it remains in the vortex."
