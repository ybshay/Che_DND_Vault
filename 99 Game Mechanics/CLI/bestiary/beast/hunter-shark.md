# [Hunter Shark](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/hunter-shark.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 330. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)*  

Smaller than a giant shark but larger and fiercer than a reef shark, a hunter shark haunts deep waters. It usually hunts alone, but multiple hunter sharks might feed in the same area. A fully grown hunter shark is 15 to 20 feet long.
