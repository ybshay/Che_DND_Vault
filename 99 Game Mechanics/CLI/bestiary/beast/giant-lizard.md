# [Giant Lizard](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-lizard.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 326. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)*  

A giant lizard can be ridden or used as a draft animal. Lizardfolk also keep them as pets, and subterranean giant lizards are used as mounts and pack animals by drow, duergar, and other Underdark dwellers.

> [!note] Variant: Giant Lizard Traits
> 
> Some giant lizards have one or both of the following traits.
>

> 
> **Spider Climb.** The lizard can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
