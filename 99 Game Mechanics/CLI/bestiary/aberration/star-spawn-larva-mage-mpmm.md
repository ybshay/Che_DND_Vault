# [Star Spawn Larva Mage](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/star-spawn-larva-mage-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 228, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 235*  

A larva mage is a nightmarish combination of a mortal body and otherworldly substance. When a powerful cultist of a wormlike entity such as Kyuss or Kezef—usually a warlock or other spellcaster—contacts the comet-borne emissary of an Elder Evil, the emissary can merge with a mortal consciousness to create a larva mage. None of the original cultist's personality survives the transformation; what emerges is wholly alien.

## Star Spawn

The Material Plane represents only one small part of the multiverse. Beyond the best-known planes of existence lie realms alien to mortal life. Some are so hostile that even a moment's contact is enough to break a mortal's mind. Yet beings do exist that are native to these realms: entities that are ever hungering, searching, warring, and sometimes dreaming. These Elder Evils are far older than most of the mortal peoples and always inimical to such creatures' minds.

However much they might desire to enter and dominate the Material Plane, the Elder Evils are unable or unwilling to leave their realms. Some are imprisoned in their dimensions by external forces, some are inextricably bound to their home realities, and others simply can't find any way out.

The creatures known as star spawn are the heralds, servants, and soldiers of the Elder Evils, capable of taking on forms that can journey to the Material Plane. They arrive most often in the wake of a comet—or perhaps this phenomenon merely signals that star spawn are in the vicinity and available for communication. When the signs are right, cultists gather together, read aloud their blasphemous texts, and conduct the mind-searing rituals that guide star spawn into the world.

### Elder Evil Blessings

Disciples of certain Elder Evils can bestow supernatural gifts on those who serve that cult, including star spawn. The following powers are unique to specific cults; typically a creature has only one.

- Cult of Atropus, the World Born Dead  
- Cult of Borem, of the Lake of Boiling Mud  
- Cult of Haask, the Voice of Hargut  
- Cult of Tharizdun, the Chained God  
- Cult of Tyranthraxus, the Flamed One
