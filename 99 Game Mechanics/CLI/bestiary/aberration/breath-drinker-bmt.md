# [Breath Drinker](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/breath-drinker-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 154*  

Breath drinkers are Aberrations that invade the multiverse from the Far Realm. They drift through reality like living voids, remaining unseen while searching for souls to consume. When they strike, breath drinkers consume a victim's personality and identity, ultimately drawing out and devouring the unfortunate being's soul. Breath drinkers avoid necrotic energy because it amplifies the void at the core of their existence, rapidly causing the creatures to devour themselves.

Cunning stalkers, breath drinkers are usually solitary. Occasionally they serve powerful Far Realm entities or Elder Evils, consuming life and souls for their masters. The first breath drinker manifested in the multiverse when the Void card was first drawn from the original Deck of Many Things.
