# [Chaos Quadrapod](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/chaos-quadrapod-ai.md)
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 209*  

A cluster of four suckered tentacles with a pulsing mass of ethereal light as its central body, the chaos quadrapod is a creature of the Far Realm, and it channels the anarchic power of that plane as it destroys all in its path. The quadrapod ambulates by flinging its mucus-covered tentacles out and dragging itself along, creating a horrid slurping sound as it advances relentlessly toward its prey.
