# [Kalaraq Quori](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/kalaraq-quori-erlw.md)
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 306*  

The most powerful quori are the kalaraqs, also known as eyebinders—entities formed of pure shadow that is outlined by a nimbus of energy. A host of disembodied eyes whirl around a kalaraq, each reflecting a consciousness the creature has consumed.

Kalaraq quori guide the quori race, and the Devourer of Dreams—the personal emissary of the Dreaming Dark—is of this order. Although the kalaraqs never fight one another overtly, each has its own agenda, and each hopes to someday seize the throne of the Devourer of Dreams. Because of this internal conflict, it is unusual for a kalaraq to leave Dal Quor to inhabit a mortal vessel and become one of the Inspired.

Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares—the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.
