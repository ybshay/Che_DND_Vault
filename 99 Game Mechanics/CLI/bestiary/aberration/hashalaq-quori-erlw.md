# [Hashalaq Quori](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/hashalaq-quori-erlw.md)
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 305*  

Hashalaq quori are loremasters and judges, and are commonly known as dreamstealers. In their natural form, hashalaqs are composed of hundreds of translucent tendrils. They can compress and configure these tendrils to form a wide range of simple shapes. A point of blue light suspended within its tendrils serves as the hashalaq's sensory organ, which can be moved around to suit the creature's current shape.

## The Power of Pleasure

Hashalaq quori have studied their mortal prey for centuries. Inhabiting human bodies as Inspired has granted the hashalaq a deep understanding of the hedonistic urges of humanity. As a result, they have developed numerous ways to control humanoids through pleasure—even as they have developed a taste for such things themselves.

## The Learned of Dal Quor

Hashalaq quori are the loremasters of Dal Quor. Even those hashalaqs who don't make use of Inspired vessels dedicate themselves to studying Eberron and the planes, and they are among the few quori castes whose members understand the ways of magic. In Dal Quor, the hashalaq quori are typically found as advisors to the kalaraq. They also serve as judges, policing the quori and ensuring that the rivalries of the tsucora never threaten the greater plans of the Dreaming Dark.

Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares—the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.
