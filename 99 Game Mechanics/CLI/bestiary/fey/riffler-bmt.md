# [Riffler](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/riffler-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 181*  

Rifflers are diminutive Fey reminiscent of gnomes and obsessed with destiny and fate. The oldest stories of rifflers suggest these dangerously curious spirits manifested as physical beings when the Deck of Many Things was shuffled for the first time. The rifflers were so enraptured with the soft sound made by the whispering cards that they made physical bodies for themselves in order to possess and understand this new instrument of destiny.

Rifflers wander the Feywild and Material Plane, searching for Decks of Many Things. They collect the cards, trade them, hoard them, and scatter them across worlds, all in service of an incomprehensible agenda to manipulate the fate of the multiverse. Rifflers are as likely to give a deck to adventurers in dire need as they are to wrest cards from an innocent person by any means necessary.

Both the Solar Bastion (see chapter 10) and the Grim Harrow (see chapter 19) know of rifflers and their obsession with Decks of Many Things, and these organizations stay alert for signs of these Fey creatures, since that usually means a deck is nearby.
