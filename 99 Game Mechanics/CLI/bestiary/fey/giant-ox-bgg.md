# [Giant Ox](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/giant-ox-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 152*  

Giant oxen labor as beasts of burden for giants of all kinds, pulling plows, hauling oversized carts, and performing similar tasks well suited to their tremendous strength. These cattle are covered in thick, shaggy hide, often in vibrant colors, such as sky blue or deep violet.

> It's easy to get caught up in the wonders of giant-sized wildlife when you're wandering some pocket of a primeval world tucked away in a remote valley or demiplane somewhere. "Look, that goose laid a golden egg!" "Look, that ox is blue!" "Look, this ram's magic fleece is so soft!" Then a tick that's bigger than you tries to drain every drop of blood from your body. Nope, nope, nope. Time to go home.
