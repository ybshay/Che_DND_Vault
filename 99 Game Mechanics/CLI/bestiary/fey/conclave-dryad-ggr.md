# [Conclave Dryad](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/conclave-dryad-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 194*  

The lush forests that once grew on Ravnica are gone, but the dryads remain, striving to bring the sprawling city and the verdant green of nature into harmony. Dryads believe that their efforts are the will of Mat'Selesnya, the soul of the world, and they spread their teachings through every Selesnya enclave.

Thanks to their attunement to Mat'Selesnya, dryads serve as visionaries and spiritual intermediaries for the Selesnya Conclave. They hold positions of great respect as spiritual leaders, and also share their vision of harmonious construction as architects, working with stonemasons and woodshapers to create Selesnya enclaves.

## Summoned Mount

When leading its guild into battle, a dryad rides a magically summoned creature woven of living branches, vines, and grasses and imbued with a fey spirit.
