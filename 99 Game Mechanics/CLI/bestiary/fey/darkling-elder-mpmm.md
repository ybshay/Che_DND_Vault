# [Darkling Elder](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/darkling-elder-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 84, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 134*  

A wise and respected darkling can undergo a ritual to become an elder. Other elders mark the supplicant with glowing tattoos, channeling away some of the darkling's absorbed light. If the ritual succeeds, the darkling grows into a taller, elf-like form. The darkling perishes if the ritual fails.

## Darklings

Ancient legends speak of a seelie fey who betrayed the Summer Queen. In the Summer Queens' wrath, she cursed every member of his house. The seelie fey's true name has been stricken from history, but the stories call him Dubh Catha ("Dark Crow" in Common), and other Fey refer to the house's descendants as dubh sith—"darklings." Darklings dwell in secluded caverns and chambers beneath the towns of other species. From such enclaves, they quietly ply their trade as thieves and assassins.
