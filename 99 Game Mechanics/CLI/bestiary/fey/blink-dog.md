# [Blink Dog](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/blink-dog.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 318. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)*  

A blink dog takes its name from its ability to blink in and out of existence, a talent it uses to aid its attacks and to avoid harm. Blink dogs harbor a long-standing hatred for displacer beasts and attack them on sight.
