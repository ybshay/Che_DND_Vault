      \ The bond lasts until the felidar bonds with a different creature or until\
      \ the bonded creature dies. This bond has the following effects: The felidar\
      \ and the bonded creature can communicate telepathically with each other at\
      \ a distance of up to 100 feet. The felidar can sense the direction and distance\
      \ to the bonded creature if they're on the same plane of existence. As an action,\
      \ the felidar or the bonded creature can sense what the other sees and hears,\
      \ during which time it loses its own sight and hearing. This effect lasts until\
