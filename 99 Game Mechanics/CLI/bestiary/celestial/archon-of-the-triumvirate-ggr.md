# [Archon of the Triumvirate](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/archon-of-the-triumvirate-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 192*  

Archons are enigmatic, supernatural embodiments of the harshest aspects of law and order. They espouse a rigid sense of justice and deal ruthless punishment to those who break the law. This nature often aligns them with the Azorius Senate, and they are commonly seen circling above the Azorius guildhall astride their winged felidar mounts, soaring alongside griffon-mounted hussars.

An archon appears as an armored humanoid figure, nearly always mounted. Its face is usually shadowed beneath a large hood; those who have seen beneath the hood describe a face of celestial beauty with a stern expression and blank white eyes.

## Eternal Riders

The bond between an archon and its winged felidar mount is so close that the two are sometimes considered a single being, acting with a single mind. If an archon is ever thrown from its saddle, it can magically return to its place astride its mount in an instant.

## Immortal Nature

An archon doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
