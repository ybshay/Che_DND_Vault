# [Cradle of the Cloud Scion](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/cradle-of-the-cloud-scion-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 166*  

A slumbering scion of Memnor appears as a dense, slowly drifting tower of clouds that never dissipates. Often, this cloud lingers over a remote valley, creating a constantly overcast sky. Sapient creatures who live beneath this cloud often display superstitious and duplicitous behavior, almost unconsciously leaving gifts for "rain spirits" while playing mischievous pranks on each other.

When roused, a cradle of the cloud scion manifests as a titanic air elemental made of fierce winds and wisps of cloud. It wields air and thunder to knock enemies from the sky.

If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Memnor emerges from the dissipating cloud, often laughing as if it just heard a great joke. Incredibly tall and lanky, the scion towers 75 feet tall and wields a morningstar made from magically dense clouds.

It tends to regard other creatures as toys rather than serious threats, and it uses its illusion magic to manipulate creatures into fighting each other. If seriously threatened, it wields thunder and wind to demolish its enemies.

## Scions of Giants' Gods

Giants are descended from the All-Father, Annam, and his children. But scions of giants' gods boast a greater claim: they are Annam's grandchildren, and they occupy a privileged place among giants. On some worlds, these scions ruled the first empires of giants until Annam retreated into seclusion. On other worlds, the scions guard their birthplaces (which are rich in elemental magic) or hold the substance of the world together. (See ""Giants of Myth"" in chapter 3 for additional inspiration.)

Scions of giants' gods are enormously powerful beings who infuse the world around them with primeval magic. In many worlds, they slumber and have become part of the landscape. In this case, each scion is enclosed in stasis inside a powerful Elemental called a cradle. The cradle protects the slumbering scion and follows its subconscious wishes, including driving off intruders. But if the cradle dies, the scion within fully awakens.
