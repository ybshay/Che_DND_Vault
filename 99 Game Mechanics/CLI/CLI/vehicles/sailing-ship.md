Sailing ships are fast-moving designs focused on travel.

A sailing ship has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings in the lower deck, holds, and cabins are 8 feet high with 6-foot-high doorways.  
- **Doors.** The ship's doors are made of wood and have AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A lock can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools, or the door can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.  
- **Footlockers.** Footlockers on the ship are iron and have AC 19, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.  
- **Light.** Hanging lanterns cast bright light throughout the ship.  
- **Rigging.** Rigging on the ship can be climbed without an ability check.  
- **Sails.** The ship has three 80-foot-tall masts with sails to catch the wind and oars on the lower deck for rowing.  

## Example Crew

A sailing ship requires a large crew to properly sail the vessel. If the characters are guests on a sailing ship, the crew consists of the following creatures, all of which have proficiency with water vehicles in addition to their normal statistics:

- One captain ([bandit captain](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md))  
- Four other officers: a first mate, a bosun, a quartermaster, and a cook ([nobles](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md))  
- Twenty-five sailors ([commoners](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md))  

## 1. Main Deck

The main deck of the ship has the following features:

- **Mangonel.** Sailing ships have one [mangonel](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/objects/mangonel.md) (DMG, ch. 8) attached to the deck. Each weapon has 10 mangonel stones stacked and secured near it.  
- **Hatch.** A covered, 10-foot-square opening leads to the lower deck (area W8).  
- **Railing.** The main deck has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.  
- **Rowboats.** Four [rowboats](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/vehicles/rowboat.md) are stacked on top of each other on this deck. Ropes and pulleys can hoist these boats in and out of the water.  

## 2. Officers' Quarters

Four beds stand in the officer's quarters. Beneath each is an iron footlocker that holds the officers' belongings. The officers sleep in shifts so someone remains on duty to command the crew and carry out the captain's orders.

## 3. Captain's Quarters

The captain's quarters hold a bed and a desk. Beneath the bed is an iron footlocker that holds the captain's belongings.

## 4. Siege Weapon Ammunition

Shelves and rope on the walls of this cabin secure mangonel stones and ballista arrows.

## 5. Supplies

This area holds tools, barrels of tar, rope, extra material to repair sails, and other supplies needed to maintain the ship.

## 6. Forecastle

The forecastle has the following features:

- **Ballista.** A [ballista](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/objects/ballista.md) (DMG, ch. 8) is attached to the deck. Ten ballista arrows are stacked and secured nearby.  
- **Railing.** The forecastle has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.  

## 7. Quarterdeck

The quarterdeck has the following features:

- **Railing.** The quarterdeck has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.  
- **Wheel.** The ship's wheel stands at the aft of the quarterdeck.  

## 8. Oar Deck

Twenty-two benches are built into the deck of the lower deck, each with a 20-foot-long oar. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on these benches to work the oars. Ten spare oars hang on the walls of the ship.

## 9. Privy

Benches line the walls of this room. Four holes carved in them house chamber pots.

## 10. Medical Cabin

Hooks and shelves on the walls hold medical instruments, bandages, balms, tonics, jars of leeches, and more, ready to treat injuries from combat or sailing mishaps.

## 11. Guest Cabin

This cabin is meant for guests and visiting high-ranking officials along for the journey.

## 12. Hold

This area houses both passengers and cargo. The ship's off-duty crew sleep on bedrolls among the crates and barrels of food, water, and other supplies.

## 13. Armory

The ship's supply of weapons and armor is held in this cabin. Its walls are fitted with built-in weapon and armor racks. The door to this cabin is usually locked, the key kept by one of the ship's officers.
