A liondrake is a solitary and territorial predator with the long neck and wings of a brass dragon and the head and body of a lion (including a luxurious mane on males). Sometimes known as dragonnes, liondrakes rely on their ferocity and their frightful roar to overcome prey and drive off rivals.

Liondrakes are voracious hunters that range across well-established territories. They don't typically seek out people as prey, but those folk who encroach into liondrake territory are fair game—which feeds the creature's reputation as hungering for Humanoid flesh.
