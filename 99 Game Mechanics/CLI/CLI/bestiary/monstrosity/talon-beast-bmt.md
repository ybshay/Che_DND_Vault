# [Talon Beast](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/talon-beast-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 183*  

Talon beasts are hairless quadrupeds that have vulturelike heads and talons. They can sense the presence of magic and feed on it, absorbing spells and the power of magic items. But magic isn't enough to sustain them, so they also hunt other living things. A talon beast thrives in the wilderness, but in its search for magic, it often prowls settlements, ruins, catacombs, or the Underdark.

Many scholars agree there's a link between talon beasts, the constellation of the Talons (see chapter 13), and the Talons card found in a Deck of Many Things, but it's not clear which came first. The card—which destroys all magic items possessed by anyone who draws it—might have been named after the beast, or vice versa.
