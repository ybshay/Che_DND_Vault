# [Harpy Matriarch](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy-matriarch-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 237*  

Happy to watch its flock squabble over carrion in Tammeraut's Fate, this gray-feathered matron of the harpies is surrounded by a cloud of magical spirits resembling skeletal seabirds.

      \ terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source\
      \ other than the matriarch, the target can repeat the saving throw. A [charmed](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If\
      \ the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.\n\nA target that successfully\
