# [Gigant](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/gigant-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 154*  

A gigant is a towering insectile creature variously regarded as a harbinger of doom, a defender of nature, and a divine messenger of mysterious purpose. Giants regard them as a plague, since gigants prefer giants over other food. Some giants claim gigants are created by the weird magical aura that surrounds a gargantua.

A gigant resembles an enormous beetle with legs ending in sharp talons. It uses its talons to bring creatures to its enormous mandibles, which are strong enough to carry a giant to the gigant's nest to be devoured.

A gigant's wings are usually folded under its carapace, but the speedy flier can also beat its wings to create a horrible sound or to spread a toxic dust.
