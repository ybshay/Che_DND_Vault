# [Ruin Spider](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ruin-spider-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 182*  

The potent magic of a Deck of Many Things can have unpredictable effects on its environment, especially when the deck remains in one place for a long time.

Ruin spiders arise when the magic of the deck transforms giant spiders into even more dangerous monsters whose acidic venom disintegrates everything it touches. A ruin spider is easily recognizable by anyone familiar with the Deck of Many Things because the pattern on the back of the cards is duplicated on the spider's carapace.
