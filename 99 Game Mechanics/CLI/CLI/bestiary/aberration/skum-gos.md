# [Skum](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/skum-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 254*  

Several poor souls around the Styes have succumbed to an aboleth's magic through its disease-bearing touch. Transformed into creatures called skum, they barely resemble their past forms, their skin turning slimy and translucent while their limbs warp to resemble those of deep-sea oddities. The change makes them dependent on water, which they must immerse themselves in regularly lest they experience painful-and potentially lethal-skin eruptions. Skum are bound to their aboleth master not just by their cursed state, but by a psychic bond that compels them to serve its every sinister whim.
