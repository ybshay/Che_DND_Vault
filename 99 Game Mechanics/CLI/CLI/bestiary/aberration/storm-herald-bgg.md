# [Storm Herald](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/storm-herald-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 183*  

Ancient and alien beings dwell or slumber in ocean depths, awaiting some cosmic circumstance that signals their time to rise. In their retreat from the world, storm giants sometimes stray into the orbit of such creatures, perhaps while seeking insight into some omen, vision, or prophecy. Krakens, aboleths, and Great Old Ones delight in corrupting storm giants to their service, transforming them into storm heralds.

A storm herald grows fins and tentacles, giving it a monstrous appearance. Its mind is wholly under its master's sway, and the herald gains fearsome psychic powers to use in advancing its master's plans. When the herald dies, it reverts to its previous appearance.

A storm herald might try to sway other storm giants to its master's service, while others gather devoted cults of lesser creatures to serve the monsters of the deep.
