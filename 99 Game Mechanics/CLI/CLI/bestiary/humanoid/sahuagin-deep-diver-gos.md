# [Sahuagin Deep Diver](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin-deep-diver-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 250*  

These mighty sahuagin, found in The Final Enemy, are transformed by the divine magic of Sekolah to enable them to better explore the darkest depths of the ocean. Out of the water, they cling to shadows and serve as hunters and assassins. A long, scaly lure that can be illuminated extends from a deep diver's forehead.
