# [Blood Hunter](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/blood-hunter-egw.md)
*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 284*  

To mortals and monsters alike, the blood hunter is a legendary figure—a humanoid stalker said to embrace monstrous power. Long years ago, a group of mortals undertook dark rituals and alchemical experiments to gain the power of the deadliest monsters, allowing them to better hunt those monsters.

Blood hunters are steely on the surface, but roiling emotion lies beneath that impassive mask. Bestial fury and fathomless sorrow drive every stroke of a blood hunter's blade. Humanoids who draw the ire of a blood hunter are often in league with monsters—or the victims of a terrible misunderstanding. Such misunderstandings are tough to clear up, for blood hunters are the kind of folk to slay first and ask questions later.
