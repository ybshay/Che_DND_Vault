      \ a sinister yet purely cosmetic way. For example, the curse can place a scar\
      \ on the target's face, turn the target's teeth into yellow fangs, or give the\
      \ target bad breath. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.\
      \  \n- A nonmagical item in the target's possession (chosen by the DM) disappears\
      \ and can't be found until the curse ends. The lost item can weigh no more than\
      \ 1 pound. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.  \n\
      - The target gains vulnerability to a damage type of the Vistana's choice. When\
      \ this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic damage.  \n- The target has\
      \ disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws tied to one ability score\
      \ of the Vistana's choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic\
      \ damage.  \n- The target's attunement to one magic item (chosen by the DM)\
      \ ends, and the target can't attune to the chosen item until the curse ends.\

      \ or both. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 5d6 psychic damage.  \n\

      \ spell, a [remove curse](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md)\
