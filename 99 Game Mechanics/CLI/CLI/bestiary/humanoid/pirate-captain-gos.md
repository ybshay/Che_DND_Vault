# [Pirate Captain](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-captain-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 247*  

Pirate captains spend their lives at sea, earning and keeping command through blood and daring. A captain's impressive sword work and biting words inspire both confidence and fear in a ship's crew. Sigurd "Snake Eyes" is the pirate captain who leads a gang of smugglers in The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh.
