# [Master Thief](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/master-thief-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 174, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 216*  

Master thieves are known for perpetrating daring heists. They tend to develop a romanticized reputation. A master thief might "retire" from hands-on work to run a thieves' guild, spearhead some covert enterprise, or enjoy a quiet life of luxury.

When a master thief completes a challenging heist, they often leave behind a calling card to taunt their victims. You may roll on the Master Thief Calling Cards table to determine what a master thief leaves behind.
