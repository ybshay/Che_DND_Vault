# [Firbolg Wanderer](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/firbolg-wanderer-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 137*  

Firbolgs inspired by the saga of Diancastra embark on adventures to create their own legends. These wanderers use their magic for trickery and disguise to emulate Diancastra.

## Firbolgs

Distant cousins of giants, the first firbolgs wandered the primeval forests of the multiverse, and the magic of those forests entwined itself with the firbolgs' souls. Ages later, that magic still thrums inside firbolgs.

Firbolgs are often drawn to the service or emulation of the gods Diancastra and Hiatea. Firbolgs' innate magic of obscurement and trickery resonates with Diancastra's wily resourcefulness. A traditional emphasis on community and harmony leads many firbolgs to pledge themselves to Hiatea's service.
