# [Young Sea Serpent](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-sea-serpent-ftd.md)
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 219*  

Sea serpents rank alongside dragon turtles as some of the most feared predators of the deep and inspire many sailors' worst nightmares. Their strong fins propel them through the water at great speed.

Young sea serpents are agile hunters. They use reefs and natural camouflage to hide before they strike, picking off members of a ship's crew one by one. Ancient sea serpents grow large enough to demolish whole ships, then feed at leisure on helpless sailors in the water. At any age, a sea serpent attacks with terrible bites, a lashing tail, a constricting grip, and a frigid breath weapon that can leave sailors' corpses floating frozen amid the wreckage of their ships.

Sea serpents are as fiercely territorial as any other dragons, and they do not take kindly to ships passing over their domains without permission. Some can be appeased by offerings of treasure, but most demand that a ship's crew sacrifice one or more of their own.

Living amid the wreckage of sunken ships or in deep sea caves, sea serpents collect the cargo of the craft they sink, amassing great hoards of trade goods, sailors' trinkets, and pirates' booty.
