  - "desc": "The drone launches a tiny orb of magical force at a creature it can see\
      \ within 30 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution\
      \ saving throw or be encased in the orb, which expands to a size just large\
      \ enough to contain the creature. While encased, the creature doesn't need to\
      \ breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Nothing can pass through the orb,\
      \ nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to enter or exit the orb.\
      \ As a bonus action, the drone can move the orb and its contents up to 30 feet\
      \ in any direction. A successful casting of the [Dispel Magic](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md)\
      \ spell on the orb (DC 15) destroys it. The orb otherwise remains intact until\
      \ the drone spends an action to end the effect or the drone is destroyed. A\
      \ drone can have only one detention orb active at a time; if the drone creates\
      \ a detention orb when it already has one active, the first orb disappears,\
      \ freeing the creature inside."
