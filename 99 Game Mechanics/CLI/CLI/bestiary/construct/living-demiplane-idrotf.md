# [Living Demiplane](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/living-demiplane-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 299*  

A living demiplane is a [demiplane](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/demiplane.md) spell that has become vaguely self-aware. It is a shadowy rectangle, 5 feet wide and 10 feet high, which creeps along flat, solid surfaces and groans softly when it moves.

When a living demiplane encounters a creature small enough to fit through its doorway, it tries to pull that creature into itself, then deposits the victim in an extradimensional chamber.

Areas of wild magic and sites that have been ravaged by powerful eldritch forces can give rise to spell effects that become living beings. These so-called living spells haunt the places where they were created, subsisting on ambient magical energy.

      \ the room around them. Each 5-foot-square section of ceiling, wall, and floor\

      \ and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that is nonmagical.\
