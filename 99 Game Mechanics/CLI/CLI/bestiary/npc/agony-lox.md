      \ the target of awareness. Agony can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or\
      \ other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment,\
      \ Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [charmed](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\

      \ lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, Agony ends it as a bonus action,\
      \ or Agony is turned or forced out by an effect like the [dispel evil and good](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\
      \ spell. When the possession ends, Agony reappears in an unoccupied space within\
      \ 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24\
