# [Borborygmos](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/borborygmos-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 238*  

For decades, the enormous cyclops Borborygmos has commanded the respect and obedience of the Gruul Clans by defeating all who challenged him. He embodies the raging fire that the Gruul believe burns in their bellies, and his wrath toward the civilization of Ravnica knows no bounds.

## Mightiest of the Mighty

Borborygmos leads the Burning Tree clan, which is the largest and most diverse of the Gruul Clans. He is almost always accompanied by other members of his clan-not because he needs their protection, but because they might need his. His companions include creatures ranging from burly giants to cowering goblins.

The Gruul follow strength, and Borborygmos holds his position only because he has proved stronger than any challenger.
