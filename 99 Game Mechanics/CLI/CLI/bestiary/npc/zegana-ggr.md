# [Zegana](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/zegana-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 255*  

The regal and reticent Prime Speaker Zegana is the merfolk guildmaster of the Simic Combine. She upholds the traditional ways of the guild and its utopian philosophy, which espouses a vision of an ideal world in which nature and civilization coexist in perfect balance. Some people in the guild-members of the Adaptationist faction in particular-argue that her ways are outdated and the guild requires more practical leadership. In response, Zegana maintains that she serves as prime speaker only at the sufferance of the Speakers' Chamber, and if the other speakers wish to replace her, they are certainly within their rights to do so.
