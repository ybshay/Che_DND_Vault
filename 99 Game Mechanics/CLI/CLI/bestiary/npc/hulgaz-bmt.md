# [Hulgaz](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/hulgaz-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 169*  

Hulgaz is a devil who hails from the stinking swamps of Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells. The self-styled Tempter corrupts mortals' souls by offering them tantalizing but ruinous boons. To do so, she directs her entourage of loyal succubi and incubi to the Material Plane in search of vulnerable mortals. When they find a particularly pitiful soul, Hulgaz might visit herself, offering even greater "gifts" to her victims.

As befits a duchess from boggy Minauros, Hulgaz appears regal yet perpetually sodden, her matted hair tangled with her soggy garments. For all her majesty, Hulgaz's fiendish nature is apparent in her monstrous features: bestial claws, glossy black eyes, and a snakelike tail tipped with a poisonous spike. On the rare occasion when her social graces fail to achieve the desired result, Hulgaz turns her natural weapons on her victims.
