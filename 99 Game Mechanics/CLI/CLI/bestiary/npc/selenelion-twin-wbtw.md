# [Selenelion Twin](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/selenelion-twin-wbtw.md)
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 241*  

Gleam and Glister are high elf twins, who until recently performed amazing acts of balance and agility at the Witchlight Carnival. Together, they are known as the Selenelion twins. (A selenelion is a celestial event during a lunar eclipse in which the sun and the eclipsed moon can be observed at the same time, either just before sunset or just after sunrise, when both bodies appear just above the horizon at nearly opposite points in the sky.)

Gleam and Glister were born during such an event, and they are blessed with magical abilities tied to moonlight (Gleam) and sunlight (Glister), respectively. The twins are easily distinguished by the masks they wear; Gleam wears a crescent moon mask, and Glister wears a sun mask.

Blessed by Corellon, the twins can each change their sex at the end of a long rest, though one twin rarely does so without the other doing likewise. The accompanying stat block uses "she" and "her" as each twin's default pronouns.

The twins are as fond of one another as two siblings can be. Gleam is the introvert of the pair, while Glister is the extrovert. Both have friendly, agreeable demeanors.
