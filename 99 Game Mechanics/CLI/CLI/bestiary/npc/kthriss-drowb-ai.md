The drow warlock K'thriss Drow'b cuts a dashing figure as the worldly representative of the Ur-a ravenous, inscrutable, and largely indifferent elder entity from beyond reality. Tapped into this dark power, the "C" Team's hoards person sees all existence as a puzzle to unlock, and he is obsessed by the essential lack of meaning and purpose in the structures of so-called "reality." Still, all things considered, he is most often polite and affable. Because after a long adventuring career, he understands that he can't afford to make more enemies.

Given his blue skin tone, rumors suggest that K'thriss is of mixed heritage, but no one knows for sure. As a young and doubting adherent of Lolth, he stumbled upon fragments of a relic known as the Black Altar, exposing him to their infinite truths and shocking the drow's hair jet-black. His matching "beard" is actually a slow-growing colony of inert spores that K'thriss believes makes him look distinguished. Possessed of alarming and asymmetric crystalline eyes, he often wears a blindfold to spare others his visage, seeing through the eyes of his familiar while he does.

Tentacles play a big part in K'thriss's spellcasting, whether wrenching him through the sky when he uses magic to fly, or manifesting in dark, suckered form when he casts spells such as thorn whip. And when enemies hear K'thriss whisper the deep truths of the Ur-typically something about how on a geologic time scale, everyone's desires are meaningless-they remember it.

K'thriss's familiar, Ligotti, is a semi-sapient remnant of a tentacle attack, spawned by the warlock's intercessor patron god. Though entirely alien to the material plane (and often appearing in the form of a staff), Ligotti uses the stat block of a poisonous snake with these changes:

- It has an Intelligence score of 12 (+2).  
- It has telepathy out to a range of 30 feet.
