# [Skabatha Nightshade](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md)
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 218*  

Skabatha is the oldest member of the Hourglass Coven. Better known as Granny Nightshade, she offers her assistance to those who are haunted by regret. Her deals often result in cruel twists; for example, a petitioner who asks to be reunited with a lost love might be transformed into one of their loved one's cherished items, such as a favorite bonnet.

Skabatha assumes the guise of an old toymaker. Part toy herself, she has a windup key between her hunched shoulders that rotates quickly when she's in a good mood and slows down as her mood sours. When she is furious, the key comes to a dead stop.
