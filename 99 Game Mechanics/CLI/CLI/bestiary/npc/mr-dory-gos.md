# [Mr. Dory](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mr-dory-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 246*  

One of the four councillors who rule the Styes, Mr. Dory hides his cursed nature in plain sight. His rare, liquid-sensitive "skin condition" is actually a form of the same aboleth affliction that creates skum, though Dory's condition is not as severe, and he has managed to retain his free will.
