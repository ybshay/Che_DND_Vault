# [Dyrrn](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/dyrrn-erlw.md)
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 288*  

Dyrrn is known to its followers as the Corruptor, the Stealer of Thoughts, the Slithering Lord, and the Foul Labyrinth. In the lore of the Gatekeepers, it is said that Dyrrn plants thoughts in the weak minded—the seeds of terrible ideas that fester and grow. Those who are particularly brilliant often draw the attention of the Foul Labyrinth, which hungers to consume unique minds.

## Twisting Flesh and Thought

The mind flayers of Eberron know Dyrrn as the Overmind, and it serves as the cornerstone of their collective consciousness. Of all the daelkyr, the Corruptor is the most adept at twisting minds and bodies to create monsters. It was Dyrrn who turned goblinoid prisoners into the first dolgaunts and dolgrims, creating the legions that would savage the nations of Khorvaire. Dyrrn is also a prolific creator of symbionts—treasures that tempt people to bind alien entities to their flesh.

## Dyrrn's Cults

Dyrrn's lair touches the Eldeen Reaches, and the druids of the Towering Wood are always watching for Dyrrn's influence. At the start of the Last War, the dwarves of the Mror Holds discovered passages to the daelkyr's realm below their halls, and Dyrrn's cults have spread from there.

Mind flayers often work with Dyrrn's cults, many of which are obsessed with evolution—through the use of symbionts or by becoming an aberration. Those who worship the Stealer of Thoughts believe that Dyrrn will consume all sentient beings, except for its servants.

Dyrrn most often appears as a tall humanoid male with pale skin, clad in a heavy cassock of interwoven black leather that slithers unsettlingly around the daelkyr's form. Dyrrn can extend tentacles from its body, using them to extract the brains of others.

## Dyrrn's Lair

Dyrrn makes its lair in the Palace of Sinew, a horrid site shaped from the leftover flesh and bones of the daelkyr's sculpting. The walls of the palace undulate as air flows through them, as if the space were breathing.

## Madness of Dyrrn

If a creature goes mad in Dyrrn's lair or while it can see the daelkyr, it gains a form of indefinite madness. Roll on the Madness of Dyrrn table to determine the nature of this madness, which takes the form of a character flaw that lasts until cured. Chapter 8 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" has more information on madness.

**Madness of Dyrrn**

| dice: d6 | Flaw (lasts until cured) |
|----------|--------------------------|
| 1 | "There's an illithid parasite living in my brain!" |
| 2 | "I can feel myself evolving into an aberration." |
| 3 | "Aberrations are the only natural things." |
| 4 | "A part of me has become a conscious entity." |
| 5 | "My opponents must bow down to a mind flayer!" |
| 6 | "Dyrrn and the mind flayers simply want to unite all sentient creatures in collective consciousness. And I receive messages from the group mind!" |
