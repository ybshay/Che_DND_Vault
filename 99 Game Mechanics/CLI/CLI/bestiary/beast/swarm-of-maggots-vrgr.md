# [Swarm of Maggots](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-maggots-vrgr.md)
*Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 247*  

Base creatures are among the first to respond to sinister forces at work in a land. As nefarious powers grip an area, populations of maggots, scarabs, and similar scavenging insects explode and become aggressive predators. Roll on the Swarm Behavior table to see how such swarms might manifest.

**Swarm Behavior**

| dice: d4 | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | Crawls on walls in a vaguely bipedal shape |
| 2 | Makes skittering noises that sound like whispered chanting |
| 3 | Skeletal visages, giant eyes, or the faces of nearby creatures appear in relief amid its mass |
| 4 | Occupies and animates a corpse or other debris as if it were alive |
