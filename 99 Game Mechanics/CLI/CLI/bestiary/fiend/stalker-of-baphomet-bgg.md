# [Stalker of Baphomet](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/stalker-of-baphomet-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 178*  

Demon worship is rare among stone giants; the destructive tendency of demons is the antithesis of the artistry that drives the stone giant's ordning. The Horned King, Baphomet, is an exception. Though he is a merciless hunter, the Prince of Beasts also crafts complex mazes as his hunting grounds. Stone giants can become mesmerized by the demon lord's mazes and enter his service. These giants can continue pursuing art by crafting mazes, while satiating their bloodlust by hunting in them.

Baphomet rewards his most faithful cultists with transformation into demonic stalkers. Such a giant grows an elaborate crown of six horns, and Baphomet gives the stone giant a magic glaive and the ability to call up horns of stone from the earth.
