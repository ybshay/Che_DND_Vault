# [Yagnoloth](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/yagnoloth-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 268, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 252*  

Anyone who would contract yugoloths for a task usually ends up dealing with a yagnoloth. Cunning negotiators, these strange Fiends handle the writing of contracts for their fellow yugoloths. Once a yagnoloth is hired, it communicates its employer's desires to the yugoloths it commands.

Although they are entrusted with leading lesser yugoloths, yagnoloths ultimately take their orders from arcanaloths and ultroloths. Aside from their superiors, yagnoloths have full authority over and expect obedience from the yugoloths under their command. Yagnoloths follow the dictates of the contracts they negotiate but always include a loophole to escape their obligations if the situation warrants.

A yagnoloth has one arm of human size and one giant-sized arm. During negotiations, the yagnoloth uses its human-sized arm to draft and sign contracts. When a show of force is necessary or when combat is joined, it attacks with its brutally powerful giant arm.
