# [Maw of Yeenoghu](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/maw-of-yeenoghu-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 159*  

Hill giants are known for their voracious appetites, which can attract the attention of the demon lord Yeenoghu, known as the Beast of Butchery. A cruel hill giant sometimes turns to Yeenoghu for help in expanding the reach of its malevolence. Occasionally a hill giant consumes an evil artifact that transforms the giant into a fiendish form. Once in a while, Yeenoghu whispers promises of power in the dreams of a giant whose hunger surpasses other giants'. In any case, the result is a ravenous monster called a maw of Yeenoghu, which is wholly devoted to the demon lord.

A maw of Yeenoghu grows a mane of hair and hunches over like a gnoll. Its jaw grows and widens, and its mouth fills with multiple rows of sharp teeth. These teeth constantly grow, driving the maw to bite and chew on anything within reach. Some maws desperately rip the teeth from their mouth for relief, but the teeth quickly regrow. Cunning maws use this phenomenon as a ready supply of weaponry, throwing clusters of teeth at their foes.

A maw of Yeenoghu charges at its prey on all fours with its mouth wide open, scraping the ground like a plow.
