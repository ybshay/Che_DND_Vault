# [Orthon](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/orthon-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 205, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 169*  

When an archduke of the Nine Hells needs a creature tracked, found, and either done away with or captured, the task usually falls to an orthon. These devils are infernal bounty hunters, tireless in their pursuit of their quarry across the multiverse.

Orthons are infamous for their sharp senses. Because an orthon can become invisible at will, its quarry is often unaware of being hunted until the orthon strikes. This invisibility can be disrupted when the devil is attacked, however, so a strong counterattack is often the best defense against it.

Orthons value the challenge of the chase and the thrill of one-on-one combat above all else. An orthon's first loyalty is to its archduke, but one with no immediate assignment might work for anyone who promises it a worthy struggle against a lethal foe. Because they travel widely, orthons are unequaled as guides through the layers of the Nine Hells.
