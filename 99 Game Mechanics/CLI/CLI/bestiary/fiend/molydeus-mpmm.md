# [Molydeus](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/molydeus-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 184, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 134*  

The fearsome molydeus speaks for the demon lord it serves and enforces its master's will. This demon is 12 feet tall, and its bipedal body has a slavering wolfs head and a fanged serpent's head. Its demon lord can speak and see through the serpent head; this master also uses the molydeus to guard treasures, slay foes, and terrify troops into obedience.

A molydeus' demon lord bestows on it a powerful weapon that dissolves if the molydeus dies. The weapon's form varies depending on the creator, but that doesn't affect the weapon's capabilities.
