# [Sibriex](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/sibriex-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 217, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 137*  

Thought to be as old as the Abyss itself, sibriexes haunt remote parts of that plane, where they use their vile abilities to create new horrors and they seek ancient lore. Rivulets of blood and bile cascade from a sibriex's body, polluting the surrounding landscape.

Sibriexes have spent eons amassing knowledge from across the planes, hoarding it for when it might be useful. Such are their incredible intellects and stores of information that many seek them out, including demon lords. Some sibriexes act as advisors and oracles, manipulating demons into serving their ends, while others parcel out lore only when doing so advances their plans.

Sibriexes can channel the power of the Abyss to create new demons from other creatures. Some demons petition sibriexes for physical gifts, for sibriexes can graft on new body parts to give the demons greater strength, vision, or stamina. Sibriexes never give aid freely, though; they demand a service or a treasure in return for the flesh-shaping they provide.
