# [Podling](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/podling-vrgr.md)
*Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 227*  

Bodytaker plants either capture unsuspecting victims with their vines or accept captives brought to them by their podling servants. In either case, they drag creatures into their central pod, where potent chemicals render the captive comatose. Over the course of hours, the creature is dissolved and its body repurposed into a podling duplicate.

Podlings are near-perfect mimics of the creatures they replace. Despite having the knowledge of those they mimic, podlings frequently miss the nuances of interactions between sapient beings. These duplicates make excuses about their odd behavior, but those familiar with an individual replaced by a podling can often tell something's amiss. Roll on the Podling Behavior table to see what unusual habits a podling might demonstrate.

**Podling Behavior**

| dice: d6 | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | The podling abandons the habits and hobbies of the creature it's mimicking. |
| 2 | The podling lavishes affection on plants and views houseplants with excessive sympathy. |
| 3 | The podling relishes exposing its skin to the sun. It resents clothing and hair. |
| 4 | The podling often reacts as if some unseen force is speaking to it, staring into the distance or nodding. |
| 5 | The podling often communicates to other podlings using Deep Speech. |
| 6 | The podling no longer understands the nuances of a relationship, system, or instrument. |
