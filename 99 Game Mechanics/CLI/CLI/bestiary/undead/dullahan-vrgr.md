# [Dullahan](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/dullahan-vrgr.md)
*Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 233*  

Dullahans are headless undead warriors—the remains of villains who let vengeance consume them. These decapitated hunters haunt the areas where they were slain, butchering innocents in search of their severed heads or to quench their thirst for revenge.

Wicked knights or commanders in life, dullahans adhere to twisted codes of chivalry or soldiership. These fallen champions consider a specific location their battlefield. This gives rise to stories of haunted battlegrounds, ruins, roads, river crossings and other strategic locations where a dullahan continues a terrifying campaign against the living. In death, dullahans are often rejoined by those who followed them in life, either in the form of lesser undead, like skeletons or wights, or terrifying mounts, like warhorse skeletons or nightmares.

## Headless Hunts

Dullahans are known for seeking their lost heads, giving rise to regional legends of headless hunters and endless searches. The Dullahan Legends table suggests dullahan hauntings that might be the stuff of local legends.

**Dullahan Legends**

| dice: d4 | Haunting |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | A dullahan pursues anyone who has one of the shards of its shattered skull. |
| 2 | A vain dullahan pursues it own relatives, seeking to claim a head with its family resemblance. |
| 3 | A greedy dullahan seeks to recover its bejeweled helmet, caring nothing for the head that wears it. |
| 4 | Two dullahans seek the same head, both believing they're the actual owner. |
