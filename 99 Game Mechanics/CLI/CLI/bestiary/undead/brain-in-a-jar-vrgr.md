# [Brain in a Jar](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/brain-in-a-jar-vrgr.md)
*Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 229, Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 279*  

Through an eldritch ritual combining alchemy, necromancy, and grim surgical precision, the brain of a mortal being (willing or unwilling) is encased in a glass jar filled with preserving fluids and the liquefied goop of their body's flesh. The transformation renders the brain immortal and imbues it with psionic power, so that it can spend eternity plotting and executing its desires.

A brain in a jar can speak without vocal cords, psionically projecting its disembodied voice outward for all to hear. It enjoys conversation so much that it is prone to talking for hours on end, sometimes to itself if there are no others with whom it can speak. It also likes to think out loud and reflect on the events and decisions that led to its great transformation.

Being divorced from one's body can tax the mind, and the longer a brain in a jar exists, the more likely some form of insanity will take hold of it. A brain in a jar is particularly susceptible to dementia, schizophrenia, and paranoia.

## Immortal Vessels

The brain floats in a jar of solution, pulsating as it reacts to its surroundings. Some brains have been known to thump against the walls of their containers when excited or vexed. A jar's metal casing might be rusty but serviceable, or an elegantly wrought masterwork, depending on its creator. A brain in a jar weighs roughly 125 pounds.
