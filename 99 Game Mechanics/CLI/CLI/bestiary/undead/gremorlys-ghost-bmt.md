# [Gremorly's Ghost](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/gremorlys-ghost-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 122*  

Years ago, a wizard named Gremorly drew the Throne card from a Deck of Many Things, gaining ownership of a small castle called Sovereign's Keep. Gremorly was a necromancer and misanthrope who had little patience for the living; he resolved to use the keep to create and house a ghostly army he would use to seize power. Gremorly performed a ritual that turned Sovereign Keep into a ghost trap: anyone who dies within the castle walls rises as an incorporeal spirit, trapped within the castle. Then, he waited. When adventurers came to investigate the seemingly abandoned keep, Gremorly murdered them and trapped their ghosts. But fortune recently turned against Gremorly when a behir entered the keep seeking a nest. It slew Gremorly, who became a victim of his own ritual.

Gremorly is now one of the many ghosts that haunt the keep. Locals have renamed the keep Harrowhall, as they dread the spectral figures moving through the fog there and the fierce lightning storms that erupt without warning.
