      \ of the demilich that can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution\
      \ saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. On a successful save, the creature is\

      \ trapped as if it failed the saving throw. A soul trapped in a gem for 24 hours\
      \ is devoured and ceases to exist.\n\nIf the demilich drops to 0 hit points,\
      \ it is destroyed and turns to powder, leaving behind its gems. Crushing a gem\
