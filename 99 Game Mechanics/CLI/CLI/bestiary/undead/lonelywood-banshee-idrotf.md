# [Lonelywood Banshee](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/lonelywood-banshee-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 81*  

This banshee is the spectral remnant of a female elf warrior who was banished for a selfish, evil act. It wields a spectral longbow that shoots phantom arrows. There is only one banshee haunting the forest. If it's destroyed, it re-forms after 24 hours in a random location in the forest, damned to its eternal exile.
