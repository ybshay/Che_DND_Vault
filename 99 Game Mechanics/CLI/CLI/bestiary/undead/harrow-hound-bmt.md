# [Harrow Hound](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/harrow-hound-bmt.md)
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 164*  

When the Grim Harrow first found the faerie realm known as the Gardens of Delight, that place was home to a large population of blink dogs. The Undead invaders slaughtered the blink dogs and settled in the gardens, transforming the demiplane forever. In time, the necrotic magic of the Grim Harrow animated the corpses of the blink dogs as the first harrow hounds.

The Grim Harrow employs harrow hounds as trackers and companions. Harrow hounds are especially useful when investigating possible sightings of a Deck of Many Things. If a harrow hound catches the scent of its prey, it never loses it, even if the hound and its fellow hunters return to the Gardens of Decay with the hunt incomplete. Powerful Undead, such as vampires and death knights, might be accompanied by packs of harrow hounds.
