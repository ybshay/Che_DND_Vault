# [Gelatinous Cube](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/gelatinous-cube.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 242. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*  

Gelatinous cubes scour dungeon passages in silent, predictable patterns, leaving perfectly clean paths in their wake. They consume living tissue while leaving bones and other materials undissolved.

A gelatinous cube is all but transparent, making it hard to spot until it attacks. A cube that is well fed can be easier to spot, since its victims' bones, coins, and other objects can be seen suspended inside the creature.
