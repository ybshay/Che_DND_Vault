Releasing a phoenix from the Inner Planes creates an explosion of fire that spreads across the sky. An enormous fiery bird forms in the center of the flames and smoke—an elder Elemental possessed by a need to burn everything to ash. The phoenix rarely stays in one place for long as it strives to transform the world into an inferno.
