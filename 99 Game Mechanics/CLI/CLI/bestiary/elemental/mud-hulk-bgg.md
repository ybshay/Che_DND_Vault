# [Mud Hulk](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/mud-hulk-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 161*  

The ancestors of mud hulks were hill giants who, living in isolation, ate everything within reach until they were forced to subsist on the earth itself. The giants' elemental nature asserted itself and transformed them into creatures of living mud.

A mud hulk vaguely resembles its ancestors, but its body consists of wet mud that constantly sloughs off around it, creating thick pools of the stuff everywhere the creature goes. It retains the hunger of a hill giant, enveloping anything even vaguely edible and directly absorbing it into its body. When threatened, it hurls masses of mud at its enemies to make sure they stay in place long enough for the mud hulk to consume them.
