# [Galvanice Weird](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/galvanice-weird-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 209*  

Galvanice weirds seem to be the epitome of weird technology. Indeed, they serve willingly, with cheerful stupidity, as guardians and laborers in Izzet workshops. They combine a rigid body of elemental ice with a core of lightning that animates them. If a galvanice weird is destroyed, the ice shatters and lightning crackles outward in a dangerous explosion. Still, most Izzet researchers find that their usefulness outweighs this risk.

## Izzet Weirds

Weirds are the products of Izzet League experiments intended to combine two opposing elemental types in the hope of creating elementals that were more stable than the norm and easier to control. As commonly happens with Izzet experiments, the outcome was the exact opposite. Weirds are even wilder and more unpredictable than elementals of either of their component elements. Nevertheless, they can make potent guardian creatures and can be urged into fighting on behalf of their creators.

### Elemental Nature

An Izzet weird doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
