# [Orzhov Giant](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/orzhov-giant-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 202*  

A few giants join the ranks of the Orzhov Syndicate and serve as guards, executioners, and thugs-the muscle of the guild. The presence of Orzhov giants in markets and streets serves as an effective reminder for business owners to keep their payments up to date.

## Giants

Giants use their tremendous size and strength to advance the cause of no less than four guilds. In the Boros Legion and the Orzhov Syndicate, they are cunning soldiers. The giants of the Cult of Rakdos and the Gruul Clans are no less effective but lack discipline.
