# [Frost Giant Everlasting One](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant-everlasting-one-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 131, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 148*  

To hold its place or rise within the ordning, a frost giant must routinely face mighty foes in single combat. Some seek out magic that will aid them, but enchanted objects can be taken or lost. True greatness relies on personal prowess. Faced with this truth, a frost giant might seek a supernatural gift from Vaprak the Destroyer.

Vaprak is a ferocious god of strength and hunger also worshiped by some ogres and trolls. He likes to tempt frost giants with dreams of glory followed by nightmares of bloody cannibalism. Those who don't shrink from such visions or report them to priests of Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet the giant in secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak's name. Only the boldest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast.

After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, resulting in discolored skin; warty scars; and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by their clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the "blessing" and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next.
