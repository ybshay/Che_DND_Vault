# [Storm Giant Quintessent](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant-quintessent-mpmm.md)
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 235, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 151*  

To forestall the inevitable, some storm giants approaching the end of their natural life spans seek an escape from death. They plumb the depths of their powerful connection to the elements and disperse themselves into nature, transforming into semiconscious storms. The blizzard that rages unendingly around a mountain peak, the vortex that swirls around a remote island, or the thunderstorm that howls ceaselessly up and down a rugged coastline could, in fact, be the undying form of a storm giant clinging to existence.

A storm giant quintessent sheds their armor and weapons but gains the power to form makeshift weapons out of thin air. When the giant has no further use of these elemental weapons, or when the giant dies, the weapons disappear.

A storm giant quintessent can revert to their true giant form temporarily and can maintain that form long enough for the giant to communicate with a mortal, carry out a short task, or defend their home against aggressors.

## A Quintessent's Lair

A storm giant quintessent has no need for castles or dungeon lairs. Their lair is usually a secluded region or prominent geographic feature, such as a mountain peak, a great waterfall, a remote island, a fog-shrouded loch, a beautiful coral reef, or a windswept desert bluff. The storm in which the giant lives could be a blizzard, a typhoon, a thunderstorm, or a sandstorm, as befits the environment.
