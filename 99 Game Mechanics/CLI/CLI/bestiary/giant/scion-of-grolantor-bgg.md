# [Scion of Grolantor](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/scion-of-grolantor-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 165*  

A slumbering scion of Grolantor is often mistaken for a hill, and sometimes people erect standing stones, a village, or a city on a scion's back, unaware of the mighty power beneath them. Such settlements can thrive for centuries, as the scion's magic causes crops to flourish and livestock to thrive in the surrounding region. An ancient tree towers from the crest of the hill.

When roused, a cradle of the hill scion rises as a mass of dirt, stone, and roots with two massive arms. The cradle uses tree roots and waves of dirt to entangle and entomb foes.

If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Grolantor inside it awakens. Standing 50 feet tall, the scion devours everything within reach to satiate its hunger. Its powerful lungs can suck food straight into its gullet. The scion uses a great tree to bat foes far into the distance.

## Scions of Giants' Gods

Giants are descended from the All-Father, Annam, and his children. But scions of giants' gods boast a greater claim: they are Annam's grandchildren, and they occupy a privileged place among giants. On some worlds, these scions ruled the first empires of giants until Annam retreated into seclusion. On other worlds, the scions guard their birthplaces (which are rich in elemental magic) or hold the substance of the world together. (See ""Giants of Myth"" in chapter 3 for additional inspiration.)

Scions of giants' gods are enormously powerful beings who infuse the world around them with primeval magic. In many worlds, they slumber and have become part of the landscape. In this case, each scion is enclosed in stasis inside a powerful Elemental called a cradle. The cradle protects the slumbering scion and follows its subconscious wishes, including driving off intruders. But if the cradle dies, the scion within fully awakens.
