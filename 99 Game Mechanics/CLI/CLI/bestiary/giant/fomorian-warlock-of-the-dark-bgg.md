# [Fomorian Warlock of the Dark](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fomorian-warlock-of-the-dark-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 144*  

Some fomorians search for the arcane glory their kind possessed before their banishment into the Underdark. They forge magical pacts with entities of the dark—perhaps powerful Fey of the Gloaming Court or eldritch entities buried deep in the Underdark. Their pacts give these fomorians power over shadows, allowing them to mold and shape darkness like clay.

## Fomorians

Descended from Annam's son Karontor, fomorians once occupied a place in the giants' ordning between hill and stone giants. In ancient times, they were scholars of magic known for their keen intellect—but also for their inflated egos and sense of entitlement. Karontor exploited these qualities, tempting them with promises of higher standing in the ordning, and incited his descendants to launch an assault on the Feywild. When the assault failed, the fomorians were banished to the Underdark and their god was consigned to a subterranean prison. Subjected to the strange magic of the Underdark, the fomorians' bodies and souls twisted until they became the fomorians of today.
