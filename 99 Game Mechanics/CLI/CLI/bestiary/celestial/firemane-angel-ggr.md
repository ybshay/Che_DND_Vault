# [Firemane Angel](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/firemane-angel-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 190*  

Firemane angels are holy champions and paragons of war who specialize in single combat. They are powerful warriors who seek out the mightiest foes in any conflict, trusting lesser soldiers to handle lesser opponents.

Like many other Boros angels, firemanes typically have red hair. In the heat of battle, a firemane's hair can ignite, transforming into a mane of flames cascading over its shoulders and down its back.

## Boros Angels

Angels of the Boros Legion view themselves as the embodiments of what their creator intended. They are fierce warriors devoted to justice and dedicated to protecting the weak against evil and oppression. They are commanders, advisors, strategists, and soldiers. Their presence in battle inspires the mortal soldiers of the legion with righteous zeal.

Most Boros soldiers assume that angels are paragons of goodness, wisdom, and mercy. The reality is that angels aren't immune to the temptations of corruption, and the necessities of political machination can compromise the best of them.

### Warleaders

The wisest, most visionary angels are responsible for forming and implementing the military strategy of the Boros Legion. Since they are immortal, their plans might span centuries, and they have been known to accept decades of losses as a reasonable cost for a more significant victory many years later. These warleaders have the statistics of planetars or solars (as presented in the Monster Manual), but their appearance is similar to other Boros angels.
