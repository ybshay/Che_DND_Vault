  - "desc": "Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see\
      \ the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,\

  - "desc": "The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a\
      \ magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general\
      \ size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to\
      \ end it or if she dies.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold\
      \ up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws,\
      \ but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature\
      \ must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16\
      \ Intelligence ([Investigation](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation))\

"lair_actions":
  - "desc": "The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful\
      \ aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually\
      \ only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action\
      \ that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's\
      \ most powerful ability.\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties),\
      \ the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but\
      \ can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n- Until initiative count\
      \ 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings,\
      \ and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.  \n- The hag targets any number\
      \ of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or\
      \ close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful\
      \ DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked,\
      \ or until she uses this lair action again to open them.  \n\nA powerful sea\
      \ hag might have the following additional lair actions:\n\n- The hag fills up\
      \ to four 10-foot cubes of water with ink. The inky areas are heavily obscured\
      \ for 1 minute, although a steady, strong underwater current disperses the ink\
      \ on initiative count 10. The hag ignores the obscuring effect of the ink. \
      \ \n- The hag chooses one humanoid within the lair and instantly creates a simulacrum\
      \ of that creature (as if created with the [simulacrum](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/spells/simulacrum.md)\
      \ spell). This hideous simulacrum is formed out of seaweed, slime, half-eaten\
      \ fish, and other garbage, but still generally resembles the creature it is\
      \ imitating. This simulacrum obeys the hag's commands and is destroyed on initiative\
      \ count 20 on the next round.  "

"regional_effects":
  - "desc": "Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the\
      \ home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair\
      \ of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional\
      \ effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of\
      \ the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the\
      \ hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.\n\n\
      The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's\
      \ fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Birds,\
      \ rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to\
      \ the hag) are found in great profusion.  \n- Beasts that have an Intelligence\
      \ score of 2 or lower are [charmed](99%20Game%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.  \n\
      - Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in\
      \ trees.  \n\nA powerful sea hag creates one or more of the following additional\
      \ regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:\n\n- Most surfaces are covered\
      \ by a thin film of slime, which is slick and sticks to anything that touches\
      \ it.  \n- Currents and tides are exceptionally strong and treacherous. Any\
      \ ability check made to safely navigate or control a vessel moving through these\
      \ waters has disadvantage.  \n- Shores are littered with dead, rotting fish.\
      \ The hag can sense when one of the fish is handled and cause it to speak with\
      \ her voice.  "
